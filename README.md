# Description
This projects deals with the use of distributed IEQ sensors inside an office space. The data's taken from the sensors were analysed and the python script used for the analysis of the data is given in this repository. The IEQ sensors were placed in every workstation in the office room. This gives us an insight of the indoor environmental condition near every workstation.

The IEQ sensors measured the Air Temperature,Relative Humidity, CO2, PM2.5 and TVOC. The sensors are low power battery operated and they use LoRaWAN technology to send the datas. The data analysis gives the distribution of temperature and humidity in the space and the indoor air quality performance in the space.
